   <h1>Stone Looter 2</h1>
    <p>Hello WerronPL here!</p>
    <p>Stone Looter 2 is a second iteration of my old datapack... it was based on commands before and was quite laggy.</p>
    <h2>Now it is Stone Looter 3 even and it comes with whole rewrite and lots of stuff as I have time to develop this pack!</h2>
    <p>Now it is made better, by using loot tables and that ensure balance and stability.</p>
    <p>If you think that is a copy of Mine Treasure datapack... Just try it... You will see the difference.</p>
    <h2>What it offers:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Makes loot from stone more interesting by introducing some rewards for mining in form of chests with custom loot inside! You have to place and open them manualy tho!</li>
        <li>It is compatible with silk touch and fortune</li>
        <li>It is very fast and reliable.</li>
        <li>Does not glich when insta-mining</li>
        <li>Adds some Advancements so you can keep track of what you've found!</li>
        <li>Does not require any resourcepack to work!</li>
    </ul>
